 ""Supported hardware\n\nWhile mixed precision will run on most hardware, it will only speed up models on recent NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs.\nNVIDIA GPUs support using a mix of float16 and float32, while TPUs support a mix of bfloat16 and float32.\n\nAmong NVIDIA GPUs, those with compute capability 7.0 or higher will see the greatest performance benefit\nfrom mixed precision because they have special hardware units, called Tensor Cores,\nto accelerate float16 matrix multiplications and convolutions. Older GPUs offer no math\nperformance benefit for using mixed precision, however memory and bandwidth savings can enable some speedups.\nYou can look up the compute capability for your GPU at NVIDIA's CUDA GPU web page.\nExamples of GPUs that will benefit most from mixed precision include RTX GPUs, the V100, and the A100.\n\nEven on CPUs and older GPUs, where no speedup is expected, mixed precision APIs can still be used for unit testing,\ndebugging, or just to try out the API. On CPUs, mixed precision will run significantly slower, however.\n\n\nYou can check your GPU type with the following command:\n\n```\nnvidia-smi -L\n```""

It is commonly used in deep learning and other numerical compute-intensive applications, where memory bandwidth and computational resources are limited.

While mixed precision will run on most hardware, it will only speed up models on recent NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs. Older GPUs offer no math performance benefit for using mixed precision, however memory and bandwidth savings can enable some speedups. You can look up the compute capability for your GPU at NVIDIA's CUDA GPU web page to determine whether it will benefit from mixed precision.
